"""
CRRao is a Julia package that implements the Statistical models. The implementation 
   of Statistical models become straightforward for most Julia users 
   with the help of this package. This is going to be wrapper package;
   leveraging the strength of wonderful Julia packages that already exists, 
   such as StatsBase, StatsModels, Distributions,GLM, Turing, DataFrames,
   LinearAlgebra, etc.

   
   CRRao is a consistent framework through which callers interact with 
   a large suite of models. For the end-user, it reduces the cost and complexity 
   of estimating/training statistical models. It offers convenient guidelines through 
   which development of additional statistical models can take place 
   in the future.

   We follow framework which makes contribution to this package easy.
